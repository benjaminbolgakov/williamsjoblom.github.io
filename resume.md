## Experience
#### Work
**R&D Developer** (summer internship), [Configura](https://configura.com), 2017

Internship focused on optimization of 3D objects which resulted in:
* Speedier normal calculations for certain meshes.
* A tool for removing invisible meshes.
* A tool for performance profiling on models in their new proprietary 3D format.

**R&D Developer** (summer internship), [Configura](https://configura.com), 2016

Implementation of an optimizing regular expression engine that parses, interprets and compiles regular expressions to x86 machine code.

**R&D Developer** (summer internship), [Configura](https://configura.com), 2015

Implementation of several algorithms for projection UV mapping.

**Developer** (summer internship), [Configura](https://configura.com), 2014

Implementation of randomly generated 3D city environments.

#### Side projects

**RoboCup German Open**, 2018

Participated in the RoboCup@Home League with the team LiU@HomeWreckers consiting of students from Linköping University and the robot Pepper. **[**[News article](https://www.nyteknik.se/ingenjorskarriar/vm-vilken-ar-den-basta-hemroboten-6909132)**]**

**Autonomous Mapping Robot**, 2017

Built the winning robot during a university project which, according to the course administration, was the best mapping robot ever built during the course. Further information can be found under [projects](/projects/#mapping-robot).

**East Sweden Hack**, 2016

Winner of the 48h hackathon *East Sweden Hack*. For this me and my team got awarded a trip to Las Vegas and tickets to the CES electronics fair.

Together we built an IoT bike sharing platform much like Airbnb. The project consisted of a smartphone app, a bike mounted IoT device and a web portal where I was responsible for building and designing the app.
