##### Hi,

I am a 22 year old Computer Engineering Master's student based in Linköping, Sweden.

My interests range from electronics and embedded software to design and UX with an emphatis on programming languages, compilers, interpreters, and computer architecture.

## Experience
### Work
**R&D Developer** *(summer internship)*, [Configura](https://configura.com), 2017

Internship focused on optimization of 3D objects which resulted in:
* Speedier normal calculations for certain meshes.
* A tool for removing invisible meshes.
* A tool for performance profiling on models in their new proprietary 3D format.

**R&D Developer** *(summer internship)*, [Configura](https://configura.com), 2016

Implementation of an optimizing regular expression engine that parses, interprets and compiles regular expressions to x86 machine code.

**R&D Developer** *(summer internship)*, [Configura](https://configura.com), 2015

Implementation of several algorithms for projection UV mapping.

**Developer** *(summer internship)*, [Configura](https://configura.com), 2014

Implementation of randomly generated 3D city environments.

### Other

**RoboCup German Open**, 2018

Participated in the RoboCup@Home League with the team LiU@HomeWreckers consiting of students from Linköping University and the robot Pepper.

**Talang**, 2017
