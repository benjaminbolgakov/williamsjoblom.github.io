##### Hi,

I am a 22 year old Computer Engineering Master's student based in Linköping, Sweden.

My interests range from electronics and embedded software to design and UX with an empathis on programming languages, compilers, interpreters, and computer architecture.

## Experience
### Work
**R&D Developer** *(summer internship)*, [Configura](https://configura.com), 2017

Internship focused on optimization of 3D objects which resulted in:
* Speedier normal calculations for certain meshes.
* A tool for removing invisible meshes.
* A tool for performance profiling on models in their new proprietary 3D format.

**R&D Developer** *(summer internship)*, [Configura](https://configura.com), 2016

Implementation of an optimizing regular expression engine that parses, interprets and compiles regular expressions to x86 machine code.

**R&D Developer** *(summer internship)*, [Configura](https://configura.com), 2015

Implementation of several algorithms for projection UV mapping.

**Developer** *(summer internship)*, [Configura](https://configura.com), 2014

Implementation of randomly generated 3D city environments.

### Side projects

**RoboCup German Open**, 2018

Participated in the RoboCup@Home League with the team LiU@HomeWreckers consiting of students from Linköping University and the robot Pepper.

**Autonomous Mapping Robot**, 2017

Built the winning robot during a project course which, according to the course administration, was the best mapping robot ever built during the course. Further information can be found under [projects](/projects).

**Talang**, 2017

Participated in the TV show *Talang* (the Swedish equivalent of America's Got Talent) along with a team of fellow students with the Aldebaran NAO robots. We qualified for the semi-finals during our [audition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhZ9dEqTDQQ).

**East Sweden Hack**, 2016

Winner of the 48h hackathon *East Sweden Hack*. For this me and my team got awarded a trip to Las Vegas and tickets to the CES electronics fair.
